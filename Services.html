            <hr>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising issue of air pollution has increasingly been becoming a serious concern, particularly in metro cities. A large number of cities and towns do not meet the standards for pollutants specifically for particulate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter. In a few cities including Delhi, the ambient particulate matter concentrations are much above the standards i.e. three to four times or even higher. Air quality regulation and actions for abatement of air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pollution is undertaken under various provisions of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1985 which prescribes the mechanism and authorities for handling the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue. The major impact is highlighted with reference to health of people. As per the available data for Delhi and NCR for last five years, Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations are the major concern &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the entire area, however a few violations are observed in NO2 concentrations in Delhi, Meerut and Faridabad. The concentration of SO2 is within the standard limit at all the locations in all the last five years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM10 are inhalable coarse particles, which are particles with a diameter between 2.5 and 1O micrometers (um) and PM2.5 are fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 um or less.</p>

            <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. With several international reports about impact of air pollution on health correlating with diseases and death in India, the issue has assumed greater prominence.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Global Burden of Disease’ estimates for 2017 that early deaths related to PM2.5 in India are the second highest in the world and ozone related deaths, are the highest in the world. The assumptions on which the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model is based are not clear. These numbers are not validated for Indian conditions and there are no conclusive data available to establish direct correlation of death exclusively with air pollution. Health effects of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air pollution are cumulative manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, occupational habits, socio¬economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc. of the individuals. Air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory associated ailments and diseases and it is acknowledged that higher the level of air pollution higher is the risk to lungs in a given area. Further in Delhi ozone &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;levels are within the permissible levels; therefore, the estimate of higher number of ozone deaths referred is not clear.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Generally, for young and healthy people, moderate air pollution levels are unlikely to have any serious short term effects. However elevated levels and/or long term exposure to air pollution can lead to symptoms &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and conditions affecting human health. This mainly affects the respiratory and inflammatory systems, but can also lead to more serious conditions such as heart disease. People with lung or heart conditions may be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more susceptible to the effects of air pollution.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. With focus on environmental health issues, MoEF&CC has constituted a high level Apex Committee and a Working Group under the joint chairmanship of ICMR and the Ministry to identify thrust areas in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment health and to evaluate the related projects. In line with recommendation of Working Group, our Ministry in coordination with M/o Health and ICMR has already initiated action towards study on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Environmental Health Profile, with emphasis on impact of air pollution on health.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. ICMR- National Institute for Research in Environmental Health (NIREH), Bhopal has recently initiated a three year duration study entitled “Aberrant circulating epigenomic signatures: Development and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;validation of minimal-invasive biomarkers for trans-generational monitoring of air pollution associated cancers” in collaboration with IIT, Kharagpur to develop novel biomarkers bearing epigenetic signatures, for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lung cancer.</p>

            <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOURCE IF AIR POLLUTION IN DELHI NCR</h1>
            <hr>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various studies conducted to identify the reasons for rise in pollution in country including NCR of Delhi specially during winter months. A study as ‘Comprehensive Study on Air Pollution and Green &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House Gases in Delhi, 2016’ was conducted by Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur to identify major air pollution sources in NCT of Delhi, their contributions to ambient air pollution levels and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop an air pollution control plan. The study confirms that Particulate Matter is the main source of pollution and levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are 4-7 times higher than National Ambient Air Quality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards (NAAQS) in summer and winter months. Based on the air quality measurements in summer and winter months, it is inferred that the contribution of PM10 and PM2.5 from different sources &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is different in summer and winter. Sources of pollution during winter include secondary particles (25 -30%), vehicles (20 – 25%), biomass burning (17 – 26%), municipal solid waste burning (9 – 8%) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to a lesser extent soil and road dust. Sources of pollution during summer include, coal and fly ash (37 – 26%), soil and road dust (26 – 27%), secondary particles (10 – 15%), biomass burning (7 – &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12%), vehicles (6 – 9%) and municipal solid waste burning (8-7%).</b></p>

            <hr>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Ambient Air Quality Standards envisaging 12 pollutants have been notified under EPA, 1986 and 115 emission/effluent standards for 104 different sectors of industries, besides 32 general standards for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambient air have also been notified.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is executing a nation-wide programme of ambient air quality monitoring known as National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP). 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network consists of Six hundred and Ninety-One (691) manual operating stations covering Three Hundred and three (303) cities/towns in twenty-nine (29) states and four (6) Union Territories of the country. In &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addition, there are 86 real-time Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring stations (CAAQMS) in 57 cities. Delhi has 10 Manual Stations and 18 CAAQMS. 20 additional CAAQMS are at various stages of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;installation in Delhi.
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to Vehicular pollution the steps taken include introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blending, universalization of BS-IV by 2017; leapfrogging from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards by 1st April, 2020; ongoing promotion of public transport network of metro, buses, e-rickshaws and promotion of carpooling, streamlining granting of Pollution Under Control &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate, lane discipline, vehicle maintenance etc.
                National Air Quality index (AQI) was launched by the Prime Minister in April, 2015 starting with 14 cities and now extended to 34 cities.
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Graded Response Action Plan for control of air pollution in Delhi and NCR region has been notified. This plan specifies actions required for controlling particulate matter (PM emissions from various sources and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent PM10 and PM2.5 levels to go beyond ‘moderate’ national Air Quality Index (AQI) category. The measures are cumulative. Emergency and Severe levels include cumulatively all other measures listed in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lower levels of AQI including Very Poor, Poor and Moderate. Actions listed in the Poor to Moderate category need to be implemented though out the year.
                Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has issued a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comprehensive set of directions under section 18 (1) (b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1986 for implementation of 42 measures to mitigate air pollution in major cities including Delhi and NCR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comprising of action points to counter air pollution in major cities which include control and mitigation measures related to vehicular emissions, re-suspension of road dust and other fugitive emissions, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bio-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mass/municipal solid waste burning, industrial pollution, construction and demolition activities, and other general steps.
                In order to involve people in the effort, Government had launched a campaign called &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Harit Diwali and Swasth Diwali’ during September 2017 involving over 2000 schools in Delhi and over two lakh schools in the country. The Government had also organized a Mini Marathon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ‘Swachh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawa for Swachh and Swasth Bharat’ on 15th October 2017 at India Gate in which nearly 15,000 school children had participated.

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular co-ordination meetings are held in the Ministry at official and ministerial level with Delhi and other State Governments to avoid the emergency situation. In this regard several meetings have been held this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year under the chairmanship of Hon’ble Minister for Environment Forest and Climate Change and Secretary (EF&CC) involving Environment Minister of the States and Senior State Functionaries including Chief &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers, Ministers, Chief Secretaries and Additional Chief Secretaries.
                CPCB had taken a number of Proactive steps to help improve ground implementation .40 CPCB teams deployed for ground feedback on air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polluting activities in Delhi –September 01, 2017 onwards Field visit to four pollution hotspots (Anand Vihar, ITO, Punjabi Bagh and DTU) and suggested interventions July 2017 .On the spot reporting to DPCC, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and weekly summary reports to Delhi Govt.
                During air pollution emergency period from 7.11.2017 to 14.11.2017 and measures like ban on construction, sprinkling of water, ban on entry of truck etc. which are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there under GRAP were implemented.
